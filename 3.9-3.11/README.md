# 3.9/3.11 phonebook full stack

This part is stored in [another repository](https://github.com/rIftimie/render-deploy-example) for deployment purposes.

I've used **Render** to deploy and rearranged the folder structure into _frontend/backend_. Each containing differnet package.json and the backend being responsible for starting the webapp.

It still uses `express.static` ponting to the `frontend/build` folder.
